# Bank-Statement-Analysis
Objective: This analysis aims to review and understand the daily transactions and document the observations.

Data cleaning documentation for a bank statement dataset from April 1, 2023, to April 31, 2023. I downloaded the bank statement to gain insights into spending habits during the specified period. The dataset includes transactional data along with other relevant details. This documentation aims to provide a clear and structured overview of the data-cleaning process to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Overview
I downloaded the dataset from my bank app, and then used a bank statement converter to transform the PDF into a CSV file. Afterward, I cleaned the data in Jupyter Notebook, addressed the missing values, and proceeded to use Power BI for the dashboard visualization.
